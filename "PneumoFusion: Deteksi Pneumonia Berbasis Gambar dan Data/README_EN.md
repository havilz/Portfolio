# DeepHealth Pneumonia Detection System

A pneumonia diagnosis system based on deep learning and clinical data that predicts the patientâ€™s condition from chest X-ray images and numerical medical input. It includes an automatic PDF report feature for documenting diagnostic results.

## Key Features

- Pneumonia prediction from chest X-ray using a trained deep learning model.
- Clinical data input support:
  - Age
  - Body temperature
  - Oxygen saturation (SpO2)
- Combines image and clinical data for more comprehensive prediction.
- Automatically generates a diagnostic report in PDF format.
- Gradio-based interface, optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

## How to Use

1. Run all cells in Google Colab.
2. Upload a chest X-ray image (formats: .jpg, .png, .jpeg).
3. Enter the clinical data.
4. Click "Predict" to generate results.
5. A PDF report will be created and can be downloaded for documentation.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Gradio  
- ReportLab (for PDF generation)  
- Google Colab
